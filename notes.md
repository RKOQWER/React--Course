# React is all about components

# Component is reusable piece of code. It is a function at the end.

# Component used to create custom HTML element.(for understanding not in interview)

# React is Js library.

# Js is based on imperative approach (we need to do all things by us) and REACT based on declarative approach (only you tell the end state)

# SPA(Single Page Application):- Ek html file aap load karate ho aur baaki ssare changes usi HTML file me aap karte ho dynamically.

#  Set up react:-

1. Install node.js
2. install vs code
3. create a folder app
4. move to that folder
5. npx create-react-app appname
6. move to appname
7. npm start

# package json: package.json is mainly used to manage and describe the dependencies, scripts, and metadata of a Node.js project.

# In summary, npm is primarily used for package management and running scripts defined in your project's package.json, while npx is used for executing packages or package binaries, making it easier to run commands from packages that you haven't installed globally or locally.

# index.js is like main function in c++. It is the first file to be executed

# App is first component in react

# npx create-react-app my-app
# cd my-app
# npm start

# React wala code ko js engine browser friendly banata hai. Iss liye jab hum log inspect element karte hain to jo code humlog  nahi likhe hain wo hae dikhta hai.

# npm start command convert karti hain react ke code ko browser friendly code (html, css ,js ) me.

# First letter of Componet should be capital

# JSX( Javascript xml code): It is basically html code inside javascript.

# We dont use class in JSX because in javascript class is reserved word.

# To get what is wriiten inside the custom tag we use {props.children}
